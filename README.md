    * The items may be split among categories in any way (2 ceviches + 1 salsa; 3 tartares)
* Labels
    * Prepare a (physical) label for each entry
    * List all ingredients, so that guests can check against any food allergies (corn, sichuan peppercorns, etc..)
    * For ceviches, indicate when the seafood went into the acid
    * For other, indicate when it was purchased and when it was prepared
* Food safety
    * Please consider food safety when purchasing and preparing proteins
    * Consider buying sushi-grade seafood and/or marinating for 2 days before serving
    * Food safety is of paramount important for kelaguens, tartares, and other uncooked meat
* Serving chips
    * Participants are welcome to provide an optional accompanying item to serve with, e.g. yucca chips
    * However, all salsas and all ceviches will be judged by tasting with the same serving item (thick tortilla chips)
* Judging (TBD)
    * The Other category will not be judged, and is considered "taste at your own risk" 
    * Option 1: Each entry is its own category (everyone wins in their own category)
    * Option 2: A tasting panel of noncompeting judges is assembled and judges all of the entries
    * Option 3: Participants vote for the best in each category that isn't their own item
